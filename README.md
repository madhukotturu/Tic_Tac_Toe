# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players that we enjoyed playing as kids (especially in boring classrooms). The game involves 2 players placing their respective symbols in a 3x3 grid. The player who manages to place three of their symbols in horizontal/vertical/diagonal row wins the game. If either player fails to do so the game ends in a draw. If both the people always play their optimal strategies the game always ends in a draw.
